I often want to know and track the time I spent on developing certain feature. With live version, this is extremely easy.
Just look at the commit time stamps in the Live Repository. 

For example, in the picture above, I worked on lv on 18th November from 14:40 till 15:23. Then again, on the 22nd from 10:45 till 11:06.
Yeah, sometimes I work in very small chunks and think that I spent hours doing a feature, with Live Version, there is no escape from reality.

It is specially useful feature if you're developing professionally and billing on time.
