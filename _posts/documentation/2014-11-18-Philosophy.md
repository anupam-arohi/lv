For someone who uses git or any other source control regularly, it may be very unusual approach. After all they made commit message mandatory for a reason! If we take a shift from this and look at how our mind works, we may be able to appreciate the philosophy behind live version. When we are in the flow, we want and need complete freedom - no distractions and no fear at all. Making those small commits is a distraction, not making them induces fear of losing good work.

Live version makes those small commits for you with a message of timestamp; hence no distraction of writing commit message. Since all small changes are synchronized and committed, there is no fear of loss. This facilitates complete flow in doing your work.
